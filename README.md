in that i have created two sections 
1.Stock Market Trends

i have followed these Key Components

1)HTML Structure:
   ->The document begins with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, followed by the    <html>     root element.
->The <head> section includes metadata such as the title and internal CSS styles for layout and design.

2)CSS Styling:
Styles define font, colors, spacing, and responsive design elements to ensure the page looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

3)Content Organization:
The body contains a main header (<h1>) and two sections:

i)Stock Market Trends: Each stock index has a title (<h3>) and performance details in paragraphs.
ii)Weather Updates: Each city has similar subsections detailing current weather conditions.

4)Responsive Design:
Media queries adjust padding and font sizes for smaller screens to enhance usability.
